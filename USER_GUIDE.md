✅ **DO:**
- Include clear project objectives
- Specify deliverables explicitly
- Mention budget range or constraints
- State timeline expectations

❌ **DON'T:**

### Optimizing Proposal Quality

**Content Tips:**
1. **Executive Summary**: Lead with client benefits
2. **Scope**: Be specific but not overwhelming
3. **Pricing**: Explain value differences between tiers
4. **Timeline**: Show realistic milestones
5. **Case Studies**: Include relevant examples

**Design Tips:**
1. Use headers to break up content
2. Add visuals (charts, mockups, photos)
3. Keep paragraphs short (3-4 lines)
4. Use bullet points for lists
5. Maintain consistent formatting

### Following Up with Clients

**Timing Guidelines:**
- **24-48 hours**: Initial follow-up after sending
- **3-5 days**: If no engagement shown
- **7 days**: Final follow-up before archiving

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: Quick question about the proposal

Hi [Client Name],

I wanted to follow up on the proposal I sent over on [date].

I noticed you viewed the [section name] - did you have any questions about [specific aspect]?

I'm happy to hop on a quick call to discuss any details.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Pricing Strategy

**3-Tier Pricing Tips:**

1. **Good Tier**: Entry point with core deliverables
2. **Better Tier**: Most popular - add 1-2 valuable features
3. **Best Tier**: Premium with all extras

**Pricing Psychology:**
- Price the middle tier as your target
- Make the difference between tiers meaningful
- Anchor with the highest price
- Show value, not just features
